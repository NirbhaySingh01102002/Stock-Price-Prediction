# Stock-Price-Prediction
The "Stock Price Prediction" project employs machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM and GRU models, to forecast future stock prices. Using historical data, we train and validate the models, enabling accurate predictions of opening and closing prices. Visualized results aid investors and analysts in making informed decisions.
